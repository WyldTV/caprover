Don't mind me, just got a few ideas and want to see if they fly. Am hopeful to extend the environment with:

- Basic Graphing
- Swarm Scaling/Control
- Logging View
- LLDAP (maybe?)
- Template Creator
- Notepad

Mainly, this project is a combination of scratching a few itches I have, as well as skilling up as I go along.

Do check out the OG Project, detailed below.

## What's this?

CapRover is an extremely easy to use app/database deployment & web server manager for your **NodeJS, Python, PHP, ASP.NET, Ruby, MySQL, MongoDB, Postgres, WordPress (and etc...)** applications!

It's blazingly fast and very robust as it uses Docker, nginx, LetsEncrypt and NetData under the hood behind its simple-to-use interface.

✔ CLI for automation and scripting

✔ Web GUI for ease of access and convenience

✔ No lock-in! Remove CapRover and your apps keep working!

✔ Docker Swarm under the hood for containerization and clustering

✔ Nginx (fully customizable template) under the hood for load-balancing

✔ Let's Encrypt under the hood for free SSL (HTTPS)
